An economic family is defined as a group of two or more persons who live in the same dwelling and are related to each other by blood, marriage, common law or adoption. An unattached individual is a person living either alone or with others to whom he or she is unrelated, such as roommates or a lodger."

5,"The concept of income covers income received while a resident of Canada or as relevant for income tax purposes in Canada. Market income is the sum of earnings (from employment and net self-employment), net investment income, private retirement income, and the items under other income. It is also called income before taxes and transfers. Total income refers to income from all sources including government transfers and before deduction of federal and provincial income taxes. It may also be called income before tax (but after transfers). After-tax income is total income less income tax. It may also be called income after tax."
6,"All the units of the population, whether unattached individuals or families, are ranked from lowest to highest by the value of their family after tax income. Then, the ranked population is divided into five groups of equal numbers of units, called quintiles."
7,"Selected income time series from CANSIM 202* tables are now available in CANSIM 206* tables."
